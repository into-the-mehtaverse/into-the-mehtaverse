# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

I'm a **web and mobile full-stack developer** with expertise in **Next.js, FastAPI, and Expo** (TS / Python).

## ðŸš€ Recent Work

**Most recently**, I was the sole technical co-founder of **DealQ**, the AI workflow platform for commercial real estate investors. You can find a showcase version of the codebase below with a technical markdown on how I architected the application. During the private beta, it served multiple enterprise users and was built with future scale in mind.

**Prior to this**, I bootstrapped a consumer mobile app called **LastParlay** which was the **#1 app to quit sports betting**.

### ðŸ“… Timeline of Projects:

## ðŸ“– My Story

I graduated from USC in 2022 and worked in structured finance in NYC for two years. I quit my job in August 2024 to teach myself software engineering. I spent six months self-studying a full stack curriculum and working on smaller projects before starting to ship larger scale, **enterprise-ready, production applications**.

Now, I'm ready to apply what I've learned to tackling some of the world's biggest problems.
